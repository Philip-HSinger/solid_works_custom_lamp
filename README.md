# Industrial Style Desk Lamp

A custom designed desk lamp featuring a raw wood base with “industrial” style. This repository documents the fabrication along with the iterative design and the CAD files.

## Iteration

The project started as an investigation into recycled HDPE and the colourful marbling that appears when combining different colours of HDPE without melting them. Originally I wanted to fabricate a marbled slab using heat pressed bottle caps and designing the centre part of the lamp around this slab. However due to some processing constraints the material lacked the aesthetics and consistency for the centre piece.

Taking this into account I pivoted the design to be a fusion of nature and Steampunk industrial style. I decided to make the centre piece a piece of dark bark with an old industrial toggle switch and exposed filament light bulb.

I modelled the new assembly in Solidworks and modelled all the parts that needed to be cut out of wood.

## Fabrication

Once I had the model I generated technical drawings (`lamp.SLDDRW`) which were critical for the woodworking phase as they served as references for drilling and joinery.

The woodwork was done in my garage with a few basic hand tools mainly with a saw and a sanding block. Internal fixtures were 3D printed to secure internal components to place inside the cavity of the lamp.

### Rough version

The initial stain obscured the woodgrain, so I decided to sand the entire thing down to its natural state to present the wood grain clearly. Moreover the round over although looked good in simulation was in reality too subtle. So I decided to make the fillet radius larger in the final product.

## V2 roadmap


**Switch mechanism**
The force needed to actuate the switch is currently larger than the weight of the lamp meaning I sometimes lift up the entire lamp when turning on. Future iteration could use “softer” mechanical switches or add weight ballasts inside the lamp.

**Tolerance of fabrication**
Using a circular saw or miter saw would ensure the cuts are perfectly straight leading to less wasted material and would speed up the design process.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed this project and anytime I use my lamp it feels nice to know I designed and created it.
